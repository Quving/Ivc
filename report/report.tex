\section{Inspiration}
Inspired by the movie \textit{2001: A Space Odyssey} produced and directed by Stanley Kubrick, an adaption has been created by using povray. The adaption contains selected scenes of 5 minute clip on youtube.  With the exception of few scenes the cuts and scenes as well as the soundtrack are geared to the original video  \cite{EbClectic}.

\chapter{Models}
The whole short animation is created has been written and created in povray. Everything but the starships (section \ref{imported_models}) has been created from scratch without using any tools.

\subsection{Cockpit} \label{cockpit_model}
Inspired by the cockpit (figure \ref{cockpit_original}) shown in the movie, the cockpit in the adaption  is built completely from scratch using povray (figure \ref{cockpit_povray}). The starship \textit{Station} on this scene belongs to the imported models (section \ref{imported_models}). 
The pilots are transformed models of the human \ref{human_model}.
